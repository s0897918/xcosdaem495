GPUs play an important role in many types of IoT applications. The performance of the GPU in terms of latency, power consumption, and overall processing time is the main reason why much work has been performed.
Flood-draining devices for high-performance computation are crucial to the operation of high-performance computing (HPC) systems. The traditional design of FDDs has many drawbacks, such as the dependency on external power sources to carry the entire function, and the lack of power management. In addition, the traditional FDD designs require the

GPUs play an important role in mobile robotics, as the current technologies do not provide devices with the same mobility and computing power as they should. This means that the power grid in some parts of the country has to be redesigned, and this is the case of the region of the Khorasan, where the grid is not used for many years. The grid is not able to supply all the people at the same time, and for this reason, the power grid had to be redesigned through smart grid. However, the idea of designing smart grid

GPUs play an important role in lowpower computing. For example, the power consumption of an ultra-fast serial RAM (SRAM) typically ranges between 10 and 100 nW at a maximum frequency of 15 kHz. However, in typical low-power integrated circuits and low-power embedded devices, the performance of high-performance and low-noise power consumption memories at low frequency is not so great. Even with a very high power consumption, the memory can also contribute to the overall performance of the integrated circuit. In the literature, many studies investigated different techniques [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] to solve the memory problems. To improve the performance of power and noise consumption, some of these techniques include lowering the clock speed, increasing the frequency bandwidth of the memory, extending the operating frequency of memory, and reducing the integration area.
In [7], it was proposed to perform dynamic parallelism by increasing the frequency bandwidth of the memory by an order of magnitude. With this approach, the frequency bandwidth of the SRAM can be increased to more than 10 MHz, thus reducing the integration

GPUs play an important role in cloud computing, and therefore we need to focus on providing tools in the cloud, such as the RRD-Cloud environment and the RRD-Shared Computing Engine. The RRD-Cloud environment provides a set of services that can be combined and distributed among several devices. The RRD-Shared Computing Engine, on the other hand, provides a collection of modules that provide cloud computing services to a group of users.
The following algorithms are commonly used as a baseline algorithm for cloud computing research, including:
• Algorithm from (Hausman and Lanza 2004) : it uses the existing cloud data to compute a cost function which calculates the fraction of time that cloud computing was able to perform the jobs. The cost function is then used to compare the performance of computing with different cloud providers. A higher cost for the solution with the highest number of CPUs allows the cloud provider to offer the best solution.
• Algorithm from (Lanza and Hausman 2003) : it implements a static metric for comparing the performance between

GPUs play an important role in driving the next big change in mobile computing.
The recent findings of two recent studies, one for the Intel Core i5-3670 and one for the AMD Ryzen 5 series, show a significant impact of mobile hardware in accelerating mobile computing across mobile platforms. Both projects have measured a significant acceleration in both memory usage and CPU usage -the latter has been particularly impressive as the average usage of memory during a recent period of test was 1.6% in the PowerPC Core i5-3670 and 10.8% in the Intel Core Ryzen 5 series. Intel, in particular, shows a very large increase in its performance in both memory and CPU while this does not change any significant performance of its graphics processing units.
Furthermore, the research by Kneesgaard et al., has also shown for the AMD Ryzen 5 series that the use of embedded apps may offer an improvement on the general experience of a mobile device. Furthermore, they have shown an improvement in the performance of the graphics processing units, especially for the mobile device where the CPU is already much faster compared to the server and storage. Unfortunately, both figures reported a performance bottleneck for the mobile device on the i5-3670 which could be an issue for large mobile devices. The main reason for the major problem with mobile devices is the performance bottleneck in memory during the application load.
Finally, in recent months a new mobile operating system (MSI) has been released by Apple for the Apple iPhone. The aim of the new OS, by setting the minimum

GPUs play an important role in future 5G communications. A new type of distributed memory, named asynchronous memory (AM) [6], enables the execution of concurrent operations on distributed RAM. When RAM is busy, the asynchronous RAM can be accessed in a more accurate fashion in a distributed memory system, since the execution is not limited to a single RAM page. In other words, asynchronous RAM must be available on the network resources to support the application. For example, in the IEEE 802.16.x network, the maximum throughput of an IEEE 802.16.x-based communication protocol, IEEE 802.16x APM, can be as high as 100 times higher than that without the availability of ASM. Asynchronous RAM (also called asynchronous flash RAM) can be embedded in the physical chip of the next-generation PC [7] and mobile device [8]. Since its implementation as a distributed memory (AM) is straightforward and does not require much additional hardware implementation, ASM has been widely applied as a memory for distributed applications in real-world mobile communication systems. The research field on asynchronous memory applications has been investigated in the mobile device area [9] [9] [10] [11]. But still, much research is still conducted towards addressing the distributed memory requirements.
In this paper, the asynchronous flash memory system is evaluated for the asynchronous RAM embedded system on the platform FPGAs. Furthermore, the asynchronous flash memory with the ASM is embedded in a mobile device simulator to examine the performance of the asynchronous RAM. Compared to existing asynchronous RAM systems [10, 12, 13], our asynchronous RAM system

GPUs play an important role in the development of quantum computing and highperformance computing devices. Despite the great potential of single-grain technology, there are serious drawbacks that limit its application in practice. For example, the fabrication technique is complex and can take a long time, resulting in problems in terms of device cost, process speed, and the overall technology. The recent advances in nanofabrication technology have made a significant improvement in many aspects, including the speed, cost, and reliability of nano-machined thin films and flexible substrates for the next generation of computer chips. In particular, the development of thinner and thinner layers in order to simplify the structure of the thin film and the thin substrate can dramatically reduce the processing time.
2,6,7 However, the thinner layers can have a limited degree of freedom in terms of their surface configuration, which restricts the ability to tune them to a specific configuration. Thus, the surface engineering of 2D thin films and thin substrates has been largely neglected. In this paper, various surface modification strategies were investigated to enhance the surface of 2D thin films and thin substrates, including the formation of new surface and volume morphologies for new features. In addition, the effects of changing the temperature and the wetting condition of the thin film on the surface morphologies of the 2D thin films were also discussed.
A low-cost, ultra-thin layer structure was first studied and successfully modified in situ through a chemical vapor deposition method. By contrasting the deposited graphene with the Au thin film, a new surface of the graphene was obtained, although the surface roughness of the Au thin film was obviously smaller than the graphene. Moreover, an atomic force microscope (AFM) was used to show the change in the grain size and the roughness of the Au thin films in the low-temperature process, and the formation of new defects that lead to the increase of the film surface energy were found and associated with the changes in morphothermometry.
There are limited studies in the chemical vapor deposition of GaAs with

GPUs play an important role in the high performance of any cloud or network. However, the development of low cost, high-accuracy and low-power GPUs is still very challenging.
As an application area that can successfully use GPUs for various tasks, graphical computing has been investigated in the recent years. Graphical computing is an extension of computer science to computer graphics design. The goal of this application has been to create a graphical user interface to the computer system and facilitate interaction with it. In general, a graph is a collection of nodes and edges drawn from a set of data attributes. These attributes are used to represent various aspects and functions of the system. An example of a graph is a three-tiered tree, where each level is represented by a subset of attributes (nodes, arcs) drawn in the parent-child relation [5]. In the graph representation of a computer system, the attributes are not specific to the computing system but can be used to represent specific functions of the system.
For the purpose of developing an interface to visualizing the data and functions, various techniques have been proposed to represent the attributes on an output node of the graphical user's computer system. For example, the author of [3] proposed an extension of the traditional graph representation called graph style. It consists of two nodes, an output node for the graph style and another node, an input node. The output node is defined as the input node of the graph style while the input node is defined as a representative node for the attributes of the graph style. In this research, we proposed a graph style that is based on two characteristics, namely, its output node properties based on the attributes and the input nodes characteristics based on the input attributes. In this research, the authors proposed a two layer graph that has a source node and an object node. The source and object nodes have their own attributes and functions that are drawn by the data attributes. Their application is to present an appropriate graph style for a graphical user interface to display and manipulate the information in the computer system.

Results

Experimental method
We use a Monte Carlo simulation of all the available configurations for the two-level transition, which we have investigated experimentally. The time dependent potentials used in our experiment are given in Appendix A. The time evolution of the two-level ground state of the GaAs substrate for the six-electron system is presented in Fig. 1a. The two levels are degenerate in the case of both levels crossing. The energy gap for the upper level is 0.7 eV, whereas it is 1.6 eV for the lower one. The total energy is almost flat, which is in line with the results obtained in the experiment for different substrates.
11
As seen in Fig. 1b, the single-particle density of states is found to be nearly flat in both states. This is due to the effective mass of the electron being almost independent of wave function to all wave functions lying in the lowest valley of the ground state. Since our model reproduces the experimental results, we can conclude that our method is a reliable method to probe the spin-polarisation of the state. In order to make a comparison with our method, the two-level ground state density matrix for the six-particle system is calculated with the same procedure described for the two-level transition, but with different parameters, which give rise to a larger and simpler model than had been used previously for the model of the three-electron-Heisenberg gas. The results are presented in Fig. 1c. The main effect of these differences is that the density of states is significantly smaller in the upper band and a transition appears at E n = 0.0 eV. This is attributed to quantum degeneracy in the two levels crossing, which leads to a corresponding transition at E n = E 0. It is worth mentioning that both the system and the system without the two-body repulsion exhibit degenerate four-and two-binding energy states above the two-level energy level, respectively.
Our model describes a system of four electrons. As mentioned above for the two-band problem, we employ the approximation that the ground state of the system is the doublet level (see eqs. (4.13) and (4.14)). We use this approximation to simulate the ground state of our model, which is a doublet (with a valley degeneracy zero), for the single-particle exciton in four different cases, and to calculate the distribution function in the upper band and the two-binding energy states in these cases separately. In order to calculate the

GPUs play an important role in boosting the efficiency of the parallel processing and execution of CPU-based implementations of the proposed hybrid architecture. In this regard, the application of parallelism techniques to the HPC accelerators would be very beneficial because their scalability to the processing capability of machines allows them to meet the demands of a wide range of applications including those in aerospace, automotive, healthcare, logistics, and bioanalysis. The main objective of this work was to present a methodology to solve an important technical problem which has been a major challenge in HPC accelerators, the evaluation of accelerator processing times, and the scalability to memory requests. The HPC accelerators usually implement low-level parallel tasks to improve the speed of the processing. However, these tasks are often very specialized since there are many possible tasks being executed at a particular moment on the device. This means that it is necessary to extend the capability of the accelerators to handle complex tasks. The concept of a distributed accelerator was designed to accomplish this and is a natural way to accomplish that task. The scalability to memory requests was the main focus of the proposed methodology to overcome previous problems since our goal is to solve a bottleneck in the traditional HPC accelerators, i.e. the evaluation of the performance of the HPC accelerator as a function of its ability to transfer information to the system. The work was carried out in the context of the Intel HPC accelerator as a model for HPC systems [9], and it was extended to a distributed accelerator model to test the scalability of the proposed design. The parallelization of the applications was performed using the distributed HPC accelerator design. The scalability to a memory request was assessed by a performance test as a function of the number of memory pages requested. The results show that our proposed parallel architecture achieves a significant speedup in memory requests.
This paper contributes to the work carried out on the integration of MPI for distributed scalability in HPC. MPI is a framework for shared memory systems where a data model is defined for a computing cluster which is used by each subcluster [10, 11]. The concept of a distributed HPC accelerator was studied through the use of the MPI MPI module as a distributed kernel which is able to work in parallel and communicate with each other in a distributed manner. The scalability on parallel threads was considered for testing the proposed methodology by analyzing the parallel processing of the core components of the accelerator, such as the processors and the memory accesses.

GPUs play an important role in the field of 5G.
The 5G will be the third largest mobile communication system in the world of at least 15 years, with more than 100 million smartphone and mobile devices in 2020 [1] at the end of the decade [2]. In our system, we employ the K-Ray operation in the system for the generation of the 5G clock circuitry with the same period of 16 ms in the proposed scheme.
In this study, the proposed scheme of generating the clock circuitry using traditional microwave radio frequency signals instead of the traditional clock signal in frequency domain is developed. The circuitry can generate the clock signal with low peak power consumption and high accuracy. In the circuitry circuit, a low voltage DC source and a low resistance divider are used to generate the clock signal in the clock circuitry. In the proposed scheme, when the amplitude of the frequency signal is above the critical point of the phase detector, it will switch into the digital signal form. On the contrary, when the peak power consumption of the circuitry is below the critical point, the circuitry will not switch into the digital signal form, but it will be in steady-state on the basis of the operation of the phase detector in the electrical signal. The proposed system has advantages of low peak power consumption, high accuracy, relatively compact design and low cost. Therefore, this method can provide an effective method of generation of the microwave signal from the clock signal on a single node.
The rest of this paper is organized as follows. In Section II, the related work is presented. In Section III, the experimental setup of the proposed scheme for generating the clock circuitry is presented. The results of the proposed scheme are given in Section IV. In Section V, the conclusions of the work are presented.
II. RELATED WORK
In the frequency domain, a microwave clock signal has been used for transmitting and receiving signal signals from and to a mobile station for a long time, and still has a unique frequency and carrier power which allows that it can be used in wireless communication systems [3]. Compared with traditional microwave radio frequency clock signals, the microwave clock signal usually has large phase noise in the time domain which can prevent the system from generating stable digital signal in the frequency domain. On top of that, because of the large phase noise, the time domain requires a relatively more sensitive phase detector, which cannot generate high accuracy digital signal in the frequency domain. As a result, the frequency signal generating the clock signal may also have low peak power consumption in the time domain.
In recent decade, since the introduction of the digital signal processor [3], the development of a digital signal processor for use in the frequency domain has increased in the field of wireless communication systems. The basic principle of the digital signal processor is as follows [4]. The power of the clock signal can be generated by a simple method, and the power is proportional to the power in frequency domain. In the frequency domain, the frequency signal is divided into multiple time portions called bits. Each of the time portions has a bit value,

GPUs play an important role in 3D data processing. They provide the foundation for many 3D visualization and mapping applications and can be directly interfaced with computer vision methods [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11]. However, traditional 2D (rigid) 3D visualizations of human gaits remain very cumbersome, tedious, costly and time consuming to implement [12] [13] [14]. In recent years, the design of new and flexible 3D human gait detection methods has begun to receive increased interest [16] [17] [18] [19] [20]. Specifically, 3D object recognition from 3D images is a promising topic [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] [28]. In this paper, we aim to further develop the 2D (rigid) 2D-object-based 3D gait analysis approaches, such that the whole movement can be reliably and objectively observed and visualized in real-time. With the help of 3D image processing, the whole human gait can be quickly recognized and tracked.
In this paper, as a starting point, we first present a simplified 1D algorithm for 3D object recognition, and then a 3D object recognition-based 2D robot recognition algorithm is implemented and analyzed. The experimental results verify our preliminary findings with an indoor robotic system. In the next section, we introduce the basic concepts of the 2D robotic system including hardware, sensing, computer model and software. The implementation of robotic system is detailed in Sec. 2, followed by the experimental results of 3D detection and object recognition in Sec. 3, and the finally conclusion is drawn in Sec. 4.
II. BACKGROUND
The concept of 2D robot vision is derived from its field of hardware based research. In 2D robot vision, images are captured by a camera system located on the body of the robot, and the 2D object is detected by applying a 2D detector on the captured images. The 2D detector is a 2D object-based 2D detection system. In the 2D-object-based 2D robot vision system, a large number of cameras are located on the body of the robot and the system works by minimizing the cost of image acquisition and processing for 3D object recognition. For a 2D-object-based 2D detection system, the camera system typically has four different optical components including two RGB sensors, one depth sensor, a camera module for video recording, and a control module for the camera processing. In our system, the camera module performs some image processing for the 2D detection system. Thus, the sensor system is composed of a camera, a digital camera, and a control module. The image captured by the digital camera is used to determine the 3D position of the object, while the depth sensor is used to measure the depth of the object [25]. In 3D path navigation systems, the 3D coordinate system (X,Y,Z) is adopted to describe the position of the object at every time t (t = 1, 2,..., T ). Then, the 3D position (x, y, z) can be obtained by calculating the 3D transformation matrix T.
Before the 3D object detection can be implemented into a robot, human motion is also necessary. The 3D transformation matrix

GPUs play an important role in the world, providing computing environments, access to power-consuming data, and reducing the size of their devices. The availability of such parallel computing means that modern embedded systems are integrated on top of their motherboards in order to provide the most effective performances. The increasing demands of embedded systems is reflected in the trend towards interconnection of these systems using new protocols. In this case, TCP/IP provides a platform for communication between embedded devices such as embedded servers and the cloud computing (cloud hosting). In particular, it is possible to have an application that connects two or more embedded servers and communicates with one or more data centers using network protocols.
The Internet, as an open source platform, provides several networking protocols that enable devices on the Internet to communicate with a set of services. Data are normally stored on servers at the local area network (LAN), or access to cloud data centers or Internet-based applications are needed. The most popular access protocol is TCP. It establishes connections using a tunneling mechanism that allows the client to communicate with one or more server hosts by using the TCP protocol. Another protocol, named UDP, is also commonly used. It is the most advanced protocol and enables the communication between TCP applications and servers at the LAN. However, these protocols do not provide the possibility of connecting two or more devices on the same network at the same time, thus there are certain advantages and disadvantages for networking. The advantage of this protocol is the speed of the communication, which can reach 20 Mbit/s (Mbps), and the disadvantage is the overhead of the TCP connection. In addition, because information is stored on the server, it can be accessed in seconds if the connections involve a few packets.
In order to overcome the limitations of transport protocols and their performance drawbacks, a TCP/IP communication protocol is developed to provide a reliable, flexible communication protocol between two devices that need to authenticate together.
This work presents a TCP/IP-based authentication protocol that can be used to authenticate devices in a network of different platforms and provide a way for both devices to authenticate on the Internet and in cloud-based systems and use various applications.
The second part of the communication protocol is also known as TCP-based authorization protocol (called AAPI). This part is used to validate that the device that has requested the authentication is actually connected to the network. In this paper, we use ACL authentication. This authentication method is able to verify that the device that requests access is actually connected to the network, although the device will need to authenticate on the network.
This paper is organized as follows. The second section explains the authentication protocol. The third section presents an example of the communication protocol. The fourth section presents an empirical investigation of the performance of this communication protocol. The fifth section shows the contribution of the proposed protocol. Finally, the last section concludes the work.
Communication Protocol
In this section, we explain the communication protocol that implements the TCP-based authentication protocol by providing access capabilities between two devices that need to authenticate in the network. It is possible to distinguish between four kinds of authentication protocols:
• Authentification based on the identity of the device. When using the identity-based authentication protocol, it is possible to authenticate the device that does not currently exist in the network because it is on the other end of the network.
• Authorization based on the protocol version. This protocol uses the authentication protocol. The authentication protocol determines the version of the protocol used to authenticate the device.
• Proxy-based authentication, which tries to match the authentication protocol with the actual protocol interface

GPUs play an important role in providing a lightweight and low-loss GPU platform. However, the cost of powering up to several thousand active GPUs that already perform many of the major algorithms for 3D graphics applications is not a realistic goal for the development of the very small desktop computers that will accompany our lives. The choice of which lightweight GPU to use is therefore an important decision.
Few GPUs exist that utilize off-chip cooling mechanisms for GPU cooling. The off-chip cooling methods most commonly used for 3D graphic programs are floating point arithmetic (FPU) and the floating point derivative (FAD) technique. FPU and FAD are both based on a single core and are computationally expensive and only available commercially available CPUs.
A new cooling architecture, referred to by computer programmers as a "global optimization concept," based on the concept of the "global optimum" (GoOpt), was proposed by Pappas et al. [31]. The GoOpt concept considers a number of factors that can influence the performance of an application, such as the size of the application and the size of the computer it is running on, which has to be accounted for in the calculation of the optimal value of these factors, and the specific performance characteristic of a particular computer architecture and system. Pappas et al. proposed several research design tools and techniques to deal with the problems in the field of 3D graphics application cooling. They developed a new method to determine the best cooling technology using an application specific database.
Various computer graphics processing systems, such as graphic cards and graphics hardware, generally perform computing in a series of clock cycle steps. Some of the processes in these processes are referred to herein as clock cycle steps, while others are referred to herein as application cycle steps. On occasion, the clock cycle steps take a variety of forms, depending on the application. For example, in computer graphics graphics, applications running in parallel with the clock cycle steps usually require multiple clock cycles. For example, on some graphics cards or other graphics hardware, multiple clock cycles are required to complete a particular graphic program. Another example is time-consuming graphics manipulation such as the positioning of individual moving figures within a scene. In these cases, clock cycles may vary between clock cycles, which are needed to be executed for each application cycle. Generally, clock cycles are executed each time during an application cycle, to speed up the application cycle. As clock cycles in graphics applications change each time, a clock cycle time may differ. For example, clock cycles may be executed in parallel for individual graphics programs, to speed their execution. For example, graphics operations, such as the positioning of moving figures, may take multiple clock cycles to complete.
To maintain the performance of a graphics application during a clock cycle, clock cycle designers have proposed several methods to increase the number of clock cycles that every application cycle takes, which generally includes a clock cycle time step. As clock cycles in graphic applications change each time, the number of clock cycles required in order for the application to be maintained needs to also change. For example, in graphics applications, the clock cycle time step does not necessarily increase from the time the graphics application was created to the time after the graphics application was finished. Consequently, there is great interest in an increase in the number of clock cycles that every graphic application cycle takes.
Previous computer hardware systems provide a single clock cycle time step. These systems include a number of clock cycles for each clock cycle step that is executed in combination to complete an application. The number of clock cycles

GPUs play an important role in low-memory video processing where latency is a real issue. Furthermore, as well as optimizing the system for high-frequency usage such as 3D visualization, it also has potential applications to video processing which is the case of the use of 3D rendering of virtual objects. In recent years an increasing number of research groups have been devoted to the study of GPU technologies, mainly due to the fact that the research interest is growing in the field of real-time simulation of physical systems, like computer graphics and embedded computer system (eC/S). In recent years, a number of research groups have shown a growing interest in the design of higher level models and simulators which can serve also to represent higher order physical systems. Among those research groups, the work of the group GURU [7] and the work of the group GURU-DR [8] have shown an extensive study of the performance of GPU-based simulation models in terms of latency, simulation quality parameters and interfaced memory usage. The work of the group GURU, with its application to interactive video processing for mobile devices, has been published by Väisäläinen et al. [9]. Here we have included two related studies in order to be aware of which is relevant and which is not.
In the work [9] the authors study the application of VRML to mobile device animation. A set of 3D model of a mobile device is provided and the users interact by means, or by simply dragging a single surface onto the surface of the device. The results have verified that as well as being able to reproduce the motion of the body of the mobile device, the VRML model also helps the user to understand the effect of the mobile device on both its mechanical and the real-world environment.
In the work by Reimberg [11] the authors study the use of hybrid graphics and hybrid interactive systems for 3D visualization in mobile devices and mobile environments. The study uses the concept of interactive mapping for interactive visualization and also simulators for user-guided exploration of a mobile environment. The results have been used to show that if the user, the device is used in its entirety to act as a 3D representation, with no additional hardware supporting the simulation, then the overall effect of user interactions and the effect of the mobile device on the device are reproduced perfectly. In the work by Reimberg et al. [2] the authors investigate the performance and also the accuracy, of the simulator in terms of time consumed at the end of the whole process of animation. The simulation has been performed with 3D graphics as well as with interactive simulation software in order to test the effect of two factors: the user's interaction with the simulated environment and their movement. It has been found that the performance decreases as the system becomes more complex. In some cases it was a case of very high computational effort that resulted from a large computational effort from the user interface. The authors suggest that a model-driven approach could be more beneficial because the system could be configured in a way which allows a real time simulation of the entire process. This can help designers to provide an adequate evaluation and also improve the quality of the simulation results.
It should be clarified that most of the works mentioned describe experiments on a general mobile device, with a user interacting by means of a mobile device or a mobile environment. As far as VRML and VRML simulators are concerned, most of the studies have focused on an evaluation of such mobile devices in terms of latency, and the accuracy of the results. In this paper the author has analyzed the effect of mobile device design on the whole process of the animation and on the time consumed by the user during the process. This is done by the methodological approach that has been chosen: a study of the effect of the design of a mobile device on the time consumed by the entire process of animation, or in other words upon its complexity. This paper is structured as follows: In section 2 the effects of design factors on the communication delay and the accuracy of the simulation are discussed. The experiments are shown in section 3.

GPUs play an important role in these experiments since the use of this technology can be costly to the system. On the other hand, we show that the parallelization of these CPUs gives rise to an increase in the efficiency in terms of execution time with respect to a single processor. In order to verify our method, we evaluated several different cases (i.e., using a single processor and using three PCs in parallel) and it was found that the performance of our method is still high at low level. In the following we will review one of our experiments. We will show that our scheme can help to accelerate the GPU operation, which in turn results in low power consumption.
The experimental hardware used for the experimental evaluation is shown in Fig. 8. These experiments are carried out at a frequency of 1 MHz which is at a higher level at the chip level than the physical implementation of CPUs which can be performed in a single processor, but the speed of the experimental machine is far from the physical implementation of CPUs. However, our experimental hardware is still very competitive with the fastest implemented hardware.
The results obtained with the experimental hardware shown in Fig. 8 are illustrated in Fig. 13 and Fig. 14. As it can be observed, there is a small lag time between the GPU clock and the CPU clock, while we have an almost parallel execution of our method. Nevertheless our method reaches its maximum efficiency in all the cases. Fig. 13. Execution of the method of Algorithm 1 with respect to the number of CPU cores used
The main aim of this section is to evaluate the performance of the method of Algorithm 1 when using an Intel Core i7-9620MQ CPU that performs a GPU. For this purpose, we compared the performance of the method in several different configurations (i.e., using a single processor and using three PCs in parallel). In order to verify our method, we evaluated several different cases (i.e., using a single processor and using three PCs in parallel) and it was found that the performance of our method is still high in all the cases. However, we remark that we were not able to obtain an increase in the efficiency in all the cases.
B. Comparison of the Parallel Experiments
In order to compare the parallelization of our method with a single processor, we compared the results of several experiments using the same hardware and the same benchmark.
We first analyzed the effect of using a one-core processor. Fig. 15 shows the results of an experiment performed using three PCs in parallel. By increasing the number of cores used in parallel, the performance dramatically improves for every case studied. However, for the highest level of parallelism considered in our benchmark there are several factors contributing to the loss in performance, some of them are the hardware, the performance of the cores, and some of them are the choice of the number of cores used in parallel. The effect of using a multiple-core CPU will be discussed in the next section.
C. Comparison of the Effect of using a One-Core CPU
To compare our method using a single-core CPU to a multiple-core CPU, we ran three experiments using the same hardware and the same benchmark. The results obtained and shown are illustrated in Fig. 16 for the two configurations considered in our experiments.
We observed that using a multiple-core CPU has the same performance as using a single-core CPU with respect to the same number of cores.
Furthermore, we also observed that using a multiple-core CPU can even benefit from the reduced performance of the whole system. Finally, we compared our method with a single-core CPU that is just a graphics card. Fig. 17 shows the comparison of our method with the results of an experiment performed using one-core CPU, with three PCs in parallel with a performance penalty of around 50% and a performance improvement around 30%. The performance gap between our method and a single-core CPU is very small, but our method can still improve the efficiency in most of the experiments at a low level of parallelism.
